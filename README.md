# quicksort-sorting-assignment
This repo implements a sorting algorithm using Quicksort on an array of 21 random integers. It sorts the array and tracks the number of exchanges made during sorting. The program outputs the sorted array and total exchanges to the console, demonstrating efficiency compared to brute-force methods.
